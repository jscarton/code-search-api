    | Versioning an API with Dingo revolves around content negotiation and
    | custom MIME types. A custom type will belong to one of three
    | standards trees, the Vendor tree (vnd), the Personal tree
    | (prs), and the Unregistered tree (x).
    |
    | By default the Unregistered tree (x) is used, however, should you wish
    | to you can register your type with the IANA. For more details:
